# Python Async

This project introduces the fundamentals of asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` library. The goal is to understand how asynchronous coroutines work, how to run them concurrently, and how to use tools such as tasks and the `random` module to build efficient non-blocking programs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to clearly explain:

- The `async` and `await` syntax and how they define and control asynchronous coroutines.
- How to execute an asynchronous program using `asyncio.run()`.
- How to run multiple coroutines concurrently to improve performance.
- How to create and manage asyncio tasks with `asyncio.create_task()`.
- How to use the `random` module to generate random delays or values inside asynchronous functions.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**.
- All files must be executable.
- The first line of every file must be:
